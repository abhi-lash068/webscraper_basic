# Web Scraper - Mini Project

This is a mini project I built for my own understanding and learning of web scraping in Python.

The script uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to fetch and parse content from a website (https://www.webscraper.io/). It prints the page title, body, head, and all paragraph tags.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- requests
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to send HTTP requests using `requests`
- How to parse HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`
- How to extract specific tags like `<title>`, `<body>`, `<p>`, etc.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
